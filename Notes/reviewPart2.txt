Cryptographic concepts:
- encryption
- decryption

Symmetric Cryptosystem
- how do encryption and decryption work?
- Caesar Cipher

Block ciphers:
- How do block ciphers work?
- example block ciphers
- block cipher mode (ECB vs CBC): comparison of these two modes

Public Key Cryptography
- how do encryption and decryption work?

RSA Cryptosystem
- Mathematical background
   - prime numbers
   - Greatest Common Divisor
   - Modular Arithmetic
   - Modular inverse: x*y = 1 mod n
   - Extended Euclid's Algorithm
- Setup: n, p, q, e, phi(n), d
- Keys: public key (n, e) and private key (d)
- Encryption: Plaintext M in Zn, C = M^e mod n
- Decryption: M = C^d mod n
- expectation: given n, p, q, and e, know how to 
    -- encrypt a given plaintext M, 
    -- given d, decrypt a given ciphertext C
    -- compute d from e, or vice versa


Cryptographic Hash Functions

Needham-Schroeder Key Exchange Protocol
- How to prove that Alice is talking to Bob?
- How to prove that Bob is talking to Alice?

Public-Key Key Exchange
- The scheme: Alice sends { { ks } dA } eB to Bob
- What are the assumptions for this scheme to work?
- Man-in-the-Middle Attack against ths simple scheme { ks } eB


PKI
- motivation for certificates
- CA
- Validation of certificates
- Key Revocation
- common products: X.509 and PGP

 

Digital signatures
- Public Key Digital Signatures: m || { m } d_Alice
- Signature validation

 

Access Control List
  - Linux ACL
      - Unix / Linux 10-character notation
      - Deny be default; path-based access control principle; DAC
      - Extended ACL

  - Windows permissions
      - Explicit deny permission
      - standard vs advanced permissions
      - NOT path-based access control
      - ACE precedence

Capabilities
- definitions and their difference
- what is capability amplification and why is it useful?


Authentication: the determination of identity or role that someone has with respect to the resources that the OS controls. 
- something that the person has (e.g., Barcodes, magnetic stripe cards, a smart card, a SIM card, RFID tag, or a radio token with secret keys)
- something that the person knows (e.g., password): brutal force attacks against password
- something that the person is (e.g., fingerprint): candidates, advantage, disadvantage

Security principles:
  - Economy of mechanism
  - Fail-safe defaults ***
  - Complete mediation
  - Open design
  - Separation of privilege
  - Least privilege ***
  - Least common mechanism
  - Psychological acceptability ***
